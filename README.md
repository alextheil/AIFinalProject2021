The target variable observed for this model is the total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale rating.  The rest of the dataset includes data from patients which are used as features, which are relevant to the diagnosis and description of Parkinson's disease in an individual.  Three types of regressors were used: Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and the best regressor based on R2 score that is determined to be used to complete the regression task is Extra Trees.  In the end, when the model was trained on a training set and tested by predicting using unseen data, the final R2 score was 0.8288.
